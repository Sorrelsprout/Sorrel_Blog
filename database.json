        "content":"I went hiking at Steven's Creek County Park for a brief hour or so. My arms and legs are itchy and I'll go to a doc's office next Friday. Before heading to the trail, I picked up some Korean banana milk from the H-Mart in Cupertino (it was my first time trying it and it was really tasty!). The air was so fresh and sweet today, not a biting crisp. It was nice and it's the first time I've been actually hiking in about a month. I stopped in the middle of a shaded section of a descending part of the trail though. I felt a bit scared to continue. I didn't hear any wildlife and as I turned to head back the wind started to blow. I'm not sure if my fear was because I listened to Missing 411 stories and was just scaring myself, or if it was a gut instinct. I headed back and immediately felt better as I hit the sunlit patch of the trail. I thought I could find myself out in there on the trails, but the more I hike, the more I feel as if the trees don't want me there.",

I kept walking through a circular flat resting area, and realized the trail that I was on wasn't a trail at all. It led me to an area with leaf litter on the ground and trees all around it, and I was worried that I might see someone there. I turned back and as I headed out of the shade, I twisted my ankle.",
